Basically, broker is your “hands” on Forex which provides you with the access to the market.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003C/dd>\r\n\u003Cdt>What is a currency pair?\u003C/dt>\r\n\u003Cdd>\r\n\u003Cp>Currencies on the market are traded in pairs – for example, the euro and the U.S. dollar (EUR/USD). Want to buy Euro for dollars? Open the EUR/USD trade and press “Buy”. Want to buy dollars for Euro? Do the same and choose “Sell”. It’s simple, just remember that your action always refers to the first currency of the pair.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003C/dd>\r\n\u003Cdt>How to make money on Forex?\u003C/dt>\r\n\u003Cdd>\r\n\u003Cp>People would buy a currency pair at a lower price and sell it at a higher price, and their income is the difference between the Buy and the Sell price. Broker gets a tiny commission from your trades called Spread.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>\r\n\u003Cb>For example\u003C/b>: Let’s assume that you have $100 on your trading account and want to trade EUR/USD. Its exchange rate is 1.25, which means that for 1 euro you get 1.25 US dollars. Exchange rate is like a price tag at the grocery store – the only difference is that the price tags on Forex are changing all the time.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>Then, you make a forecast – for example, you believe that Euro will rise versus the US Dollar.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>Next, you buy 80 euros for your $100 and wait for the exchange rate to change.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>Let’s imagine it rose from 1.25 to 1.35 – it is a profitable situation for you, so you can close the trade at this point. Now, you can exchange your 80 euros back to 108 dollars, and get your profit of $8.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>If you think this amount of money isn’t worth bothering, there’s great news: your broker can help you make much more money with a special tool called leverage. Leverage is funds you borrow from your broker to multiply your deposit.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>For example, if you used the leverage of 1: 3000 at FBS for a similar trade from the previous example, you would get $2400 with just one trade. So, you invest $100 and trade $300 000! Not bad, right?\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>Just remember: higher profit involves higher risk, so risk management is an important part of trading!\u003C/p>\r\n\u003C/dd>\r\n\u003Cdt>How to make forecasts?\u003C/dt>\r\n\u003Cdd>\r\n\u003Cp>The last question is: how do traders know what currency pairs to trade and when to buy or sell them?\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>Currency rate depends on its supply and demand, which may change depending on the economic situation of the country (GDP, inflation, the labor market situation, etc.). This is why political, economic and social phenomena that influence local economy also influence currency rates. Learning HOW these factors influence profitability is the key to Forex trading.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>There are 2 major tools that indicate the best moment to buy or sell.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003C/dd>\r\n\u003Cdt>Fundamental analysis\u003C/dt>\r\n\u003Cdd>\r\n\u003Cp>It is all about following economic news in different countries.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>\r\n\u003Cb>For example:\u003C/b> you see that Canadian unemployment rate declined, which means that the CAD will rise. Sell USD/CAD and just wait!\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>A thing like that happened on January 5th, 2018 – Canadian unemployment rate fell, and USD fell to CAD from 1.250 to 1.236. Trading $100 with 1: 3000 leverage, a trader could have made a profit of $3398.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003C/dd>\r\n\u003Cdt>Graphic analysis\u003C/dt>\r\n\u003Cdd>\r\n\u003Cp>You can use currency rate charts to make forecasts – the pattern on the graph can tell you what to do. Let’s review the simplest and most popular “Head and Shoulders” pattern.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>It consists of three peaks that make a “head” and two “shoulders”.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>When all three peaks are formed, draw a neckline through the lows that were formed by all three peaks. After that, measure a distance from the “head” peak to the neckline. It is an approximate distance that the pair will go down from the neckline. The “Head and Shoulders” pattern is a strong signal to sell.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>Luckily, you don’t need to have a degree in finance to master it! FBS broker has an exceptional section of educational and analytical materials explaining how to act when prices go up or down in simple terms.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003C/dd>\r\n\u003C/dl>","content.vocabulary.buy-sell":"\u003Cp>'Trading Forex' means buying or selling currency pairs, metals, or indices. Currencies are always traded in pairs. It's logical: to find out the relative value of one currency, you need to compare it with another currency. When you buy one currency, you automatically sell another currency.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>In practice, this means that you perform an operation with a pair made of these two currencies. For example, if you expect the euro to appreciate against the US dollar, you buy EUR/USD. This is a common Forex transaction ('trade'). To perform it, you need to open a trading program (MetaTrader 4 or 5 or FBS Trader), click on a 'New order' button and then choose 'Buy'.\u003C/p>","content.vocabulary.currencies":"\u003Cp>The first currency in a pair is called the base currency, while the second currency is called the quote or counter currency. The price of the base currency is always calculated in units of the quote currency.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>For example, the exchange rate for EUR/USD is 1.1900. It means that 1 euro costs 1.1900 US dollars (one dollar and 19 cents). It’s essential to learn that the terms ‘buy’ and ‘sell’ apply to the base currency (in this example, the EUR is the base currency, the USD is the quote currency).\u003C/p>","content.vocabulary.lot":"\u003Cp>A lot is a number of currency units. A standard lot equal to 100 000 units of a base currency. For EUR/USD, one lot means 100 000 EUR. To open a trade, you will need to decide how much money to put into it. In a trading platform, you will see the ‘volume’ parameter when you decide to open a new order. If you want to trade 1 lot, choose ‘1.00’. You can also trade several lots or partial lots. The smallest trade size is ‘0.01’ (1 000 units of a base currency). Notice that the actual amount of money needed to open such a trade may be even smaller because of leverage.\u003C/p>","content.vocabulary.order":"\u003Cp>To trade Forex, you need to place orders – give special commands to your broker in the trading platform. There are several types of orders.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>Market orders – buy and sell – will allow you to open positions at the current market price. The position will be opened immediately after you place such an order. What if you don’t like the current price? For example, you are confident that the pair will skyrocket, but only if it reaches a certain level. Pending orders will help you out! They will allow you to choose entry levels in advance, so that you won’t have to sit in front of the screen, waiting. With a pending order, the trade will be automatically opened once the price gets to the level that you have chosen. Handy, right?\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>There are four types of pending orders, and no words will make them clearer for you than the picture below:\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>Well, you’ve learned how to open positions, but what about closing trades? In order to close profitable positions, use an order type called Take Profit. In order to close an unprofitable trade and prevent a bigger loss, use a Stop Loss. For example, you set a Take Profit 100 points away from your entry point. As soon as the market moves 100 points in your favor, your order will be automatically closed and 100 points in USD or EUR will be added to your account. The protective Stop Loss in a trade like this may equal 30 points.\u003C/p>","content.vocabulary.point":"\u003Cp>Points represent the smallest change a price can make. Exchange rates are counted to five decimal points. For example, the price GBP/USD can be like this: 1.3000. However, there are some pairs that have 3 decimal points. For example, the USD/JPY may trade at 103.705. The last decimal sign of a price/quotation represents a point.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>If EUR/USD changed from 1.19000 to 1.19005, this would be a change of 5 points. If USD/JPY changed from 103.000 to 103.013, this would be a change of 13 points.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>Let’s learn how to calculate the value of one point.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>We will use the USD/JPY pair as an example. The exchange rate is 103.800.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>(0.001 (a point) / 103.800 (an exchange rate) X 100 000 (a standard lot) = $0.96 per point\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>Let’s consider a pair where the USD is not a base currency. For example, EUR/USD. If the USD is your account currency and the exchange rate is 1.19000, the calculation will be like this:\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>(0.00001 / 1) X 100 000 = $1 per point\u003C/p>","content.vocabulary.profit":"\u003Cp>To make a profit you need to buy at a lower price and close the trade when the price increases or to sell at a higher price and close the trade when the price declines. The decision to buy or sell a currency pair depends on your expectations of the future price. If you think that EUR/USD will rise, you buy this pair or, in other words, open a long position on this pair. If you think that the EUR/USD will fall, you sell the pair or, as traders say, open a short position. As some time passes and the price of EUR/USD changes, you close the position and get the profit if the price changes in line with your expectations. If the price moved in the opposite way, you would have a loss on this transaction.\u003C/p>","label.about":"About","label.about-connect":"Connect your Facebook account to your personal area.","label.about-download":"Download the FBS – Trading Broker to double your bonus (get additional $70).","label.about-get-free":"Get free $70.","label.about-learn":"Learn trading and pass a quick Forex trading test.","label.about-trade":"Trade for 20 active trading days with max 5 days missed in the process and withdraw the profit earned with the Level Up Bonus account","label.about-verify":"Verify your email.","label.account.active-days":"Active trading days","label.account.bonus-progress":"Bonus progress","label.account.btn-level-up":"Level Up!","label.balance":"Balance","label.btn-basic-concepts":"Basic concepts of the forex market","label.btn-create-account":"Create account","label.btn-email-step":"Confirm email","label.btn-facebook-step":"Connect your account","label.btn-how-to":"How to make money on forex","label.btn-modal":"Continue to level up","label.btn-ok":"Ok","label.btn-popup-cancel":"Cancel","label.btn-popup-connect-facebook":"Connect another account","label.btn-proceed":"Proceed","label.btn-skip":"Skip","label.btn-test-step":"Start your test","label.btn-trading-step":"Check progress","label.btn-transaction":"","label.btn-transfer-profit":"Transfer profit","label.btn-welcome-step":"Open level up account","label.btn.popup-completed-test":"Continue to level up","label.completed-failed-result":"Your profit {{ profit }}","label.day":"day","label.days-left":"Days left","label.days-missed":"Days missed","label.days-traded":"Days traded","label.disqualified-result":"You are disqualified","label.double-step":"Double your bonus","label.email-step":"Confirm your email","label.facebook-step":"Join us in Facebook","label.failed-result":"Conditions are not met","label.fulfill-result":"Your profit {{ profit }}","label.how-to-forex":"How to make money on forex","label.level-beginner":"Beginner","label.level-middle":"Middle","label.level-professional":"Professional","label.modal-title":"You reached a new level!","label.profit":"Profit","label.quiz":"The test","label.terms-and-conditions":"Terms and conditions","label.test-step":"Take the test","label.total-profit":"Total profit","label.traded-lots":"Traded lots","label.trading-disabled":"Trading is disabled","label.trading-step":"Start trading","label.transfer-funds-progress":"Results in progress","label.transfer-rejected":"Rejected","label.transferred-result":"Congratulations!","label.vocabulary":"Your basic Forex vocabulary","label.vocabulary.buy-sell":"Buy or Sell","label.vocabulary.currencies":"Base and quote currencies","label.vocabulary.finish":"Well done!

Traders get Status Points for their closed orders; Partners get Status Points for the closed orders of the Partner’s Clients. The difference between the Open and Close prices must exceed fifty-nine (59) points.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Status Points are calculated according to the following formula:\u003Cbr>\u003Cstrong>Number of traded lots * Loyalty Status Coefficient\u003C/strong>\u003Cbr>(see the table in Annex №1 for Coefficient).\u003C/li>\u003Cli>If you trade stocks in Meta Trader 5, the stock lot is counted as 0.1 of a standard lot. Consider this when trading for Status Points.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>The progress bar in your Personal Area shows how many Status Points you have now and how many you need to get the next Loyalty Status.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>When Participants upgrade to their next Loyalty Status, their Status Points are deducted, and the Status Points calculation starts over. Note that Status Points are not deducted upon a prize request.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Status Points cannot be transferred to other clients of the Company.\u003C/li>\u003C/ol>\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Loyalty Status\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\u003Col>\u003Cli>Loyalty Status is the level of a Loyalty Program Participant. Loyalty Status depends on how many Status Points the Participant has.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>There are four Loyalty Status Levels (from the lowest to the highest):\u003Cul>\u003Cli>Green\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Silver\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Gold\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Platinum\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>\u003C/li>\u003Cli>The higher your Loyalty Status is, the more prizes you can request for your Prize Points. Your Prize Points Coefficient increases according to your level (starting from Gold Status).\u003C/li>\u003Cli>For the Prize Points Coefficient and Loyalty Status, see the table in Annex №1.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>To upgrade the Loyalty Status, you can get Status Points and/or increase the total deposit amount (or the turnover of your clients). For the Status Points and total deposit amount required to get Loyalty Status, see the tables in Annex №2.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>When you get a new Loyalty Status, the Status Points calculation, as well as the calculation of your total deposit amount or your clients’ turnover, starts over.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Your Loyalty Status is valid throughout one (1) calendar year from its attainment. If you meet the requirements for an upgrade, a new Loyalty Status will be assigned to you automatically. After a 365-day period, your Loyalty Status will still be updated according to the conditions: remain unchanged or go down to a lower level.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Only the progress made within the previous calendar year is considered for the fulfillment of the conditions.\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Example:\u003C/strong> A Participant has a Gold Loyalty Status from December31, 2021. Suppose the Participant won’t upgrade to a Platinum Loyalty Status by December 31, 2022 and fail to confirm the current Gold Loyalty Status (get enough Status Points and deposit enough funds or get enough clients’ turnover). In that case, the Status of the Participant will change to a Silver one (in case the Participant has a sufficient amount of Status Points and deposits enough or gets enough of the clients’ turnover) or a Green one (if the Participant has not fulfilled the conditions for the Silver status).\u003C/p>\u003C/li>\u003Cli>A Participant can be a Trader, a Partner, or both. If a Participant is both a Trader and a Partner, this Participant gets Points for all the activities. The Loyalty Status upgrade happens whenever the Participant meets conditions for Traders or Partners:\u003Cul>\u003Cli>Upgrade (Traders): Status Points, deposits.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Upgrade (Partners): Status Points, clients’ turnover.\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>\u003C/li>\u003C/ol>\u003C/li>\u003Cli>FBS Prize Points\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\u003Col>\u003Cli>FBS Prize Points (hereinafter “Prize Points”) are the points that can be exchanged for prizes and rewards.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>The Prize Points calculation is made according to the formula applied to the Status Points calculation (see in 2.1.3.). When you upgrade to a new Loyalty Status, your Loyalty Status Coefficient will be increased so that you can earn points faster.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Prize Points are credited once an order is closed. The Prize Points history is available in the “History” section.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Prize Points will not be credited for trading on demo or bonus funds.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Prize Points are valid for one (1) year from the day of their attainment. The Prize Points that were not redeemed within the validity period (one (1) year after crediting) expire after the period is over. Prize Points expire gradually.\u003Cbr>\u003Cstrong>Example:\u003C/strong> You get 10 Prize Points in January and 20 more in February, so 30 in total. They will be valid for 1 year, and you can use them anytime. If you don’t redeem your Prize Points, next year in January, the first 10 will expire, and in a month, the rest 20 will expire too.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Participants may invite their friends to FBS, and both will be rewarded one (1) Prize Point for one (1) Friend if the following requirements are met:\u003Cul>\u003Cli>The person invited (Friend) doesn’t have an FBS account yet;\u003C/li>\u003Cli>A Friend has followed a special referral link (“ppf=”) shared by a Participant to open a new FBS account;\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Prize Points are credited to both Participant and Friend whenever the Friend verifies their Personal Area and trades 2 lots (the difference between the Open and Close price must not be less than 59 points).\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Note that the “Invite a friend” option has no relation to the FBS IB Program.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>You are allowed to invite as many Friends as you want. You will not get a Partner commission for your Friends’ trading. If a Friend registered via a referral link and traded 2 lots but didn’t join the Loyalty Program, the Friend will receive the Prize Point automatically after joining.\u003C/li>\u003C/ol>\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Prize Points depending on Loyalty Status\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\u003Col>\u003Cli>Participants can exchange Prize Points for prizes, depending on their current Loyalty Status. To request a desired prize, Participants have to get the required number of Prize Points and fulfill the conditions considering the number of active trading days (for Traders) or the number of active clients (for Partners).\u003C/li>\u003Cli>An active trading day is a day when a Participant closes at least one order. The difference between the Open and Close price must exceed fifty-nine (59) points.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>An active client is a client who\u003Cul>\u003Cli>attaches to the Partner after the Partner has joined the Loyalty Program;\u003C/li>\u003Cli>has a fully verified FBS account (verified identity and email); and\u003C/li>\u003Cli>opens orders the Partner gets Prize Points for.\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>\u003C/li>\u003Cli>One active client is added to the Partner’s progress in the Loyalty Program only once.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>The Partner gets Prize Points for the trades of all attached clients, including active clients, new ones, and those attached to the Partner before the Partner joined the Loyalty Program.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>The counting of active trading days and active clients starts right after joining the Loyalty Program.\u003C/li>\u003C/ol>\u003C/li>\u003C/ol>\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Prizes\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\u003Col>\u003Cli>Current information on prizes\u003Cbr>\u003Cbr>\u003Col>\u003Cli>All current information regarding the availability of the prizes will be listed in the Personal Area.

If you switch to a Gold Loyalty Status without requesting your iPhone on a Silver Loyalty Status, you can request two iPhones if you have enough Prize Points and active trading days or active clients.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Example 2: you claim an iPhone on a Silver Loyalty Status. After that, you go down to a lower Status (a Green one) for some reason. When you get a Silver Loyalty Status again, you cannot claim an iPhone again.\u003C/p>\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Once the prize is requested by a Participant, Prize Points will be deducted, and active trading days or the number of active clients will be reset automatically.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>You can see the full list of the claimed prizes, their status, and tracking information in the “Order History” section of your Personal Area, as well as other details.

Basically, broker is your “hands” on Forex which provides you with the access to the market.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003C/dd>\r\n\u003Cdt>What is a currency pair?\u003C/dt>\r\n\u003Cdd>\r\n\u003Cp>Currencies on the market are traded in pairs – for example, the euro and the U.S. dollar (EUR/USD). Want to buy Euro for dollars? Open the EUR/USD trade and press “Buy”. Want to buy dollars for Euro? Do the same and choose “Sell”. It’s simple, just remember that your action always refers to the first currency of the pair.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003C/dd>\r\n\u003Cdt>How to make money on Forex?\u003C/dt>\r\n\u003Cdd>\r\n\u003Cp>People would buy a currency pair at a lower price and sell it at a higher price, and their income is the difference between the Buy and the Sell price. Broker gets a tiny commission from your trades called Spread.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>\r\n\u003Cb>For example\u003C/b>: Let’s assume that you have $100 on your trading account and want to trade EUR/USD. Its exchange rate is 1.25, which means that for 1 euro you get 1.25 US dollars. Exchange rate is like a price tag at the grocery store – the only difference is that the price tags on Forex are changing all the time.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>Then, you make a forecast – for example, you believe that Euro will rise versus the US Dollar.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>Next, you buy 80 euros for your $100 and wait for the exchange rate to change.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>Let’s imagine it rose from 1.25 to 1.35 – it is a profitable situation for you, so you can close the trade at this point. Now, you can exchange your 80 euros back to 108 dollars, and get your profit of $8.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>If you think this amount of money isn’t worth bothering, there’s great news: your broker can help you make much more money with a special tool called leverage. Leverage is funds you borrow from your broker to multiply your deposit.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>For example, if you used the leverage of 1: 3000 at FBS for a similar trade from the previous example, you would get $2400 with just one trade. So, you invest $100 and trade $300 000! Not bad, right?\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>Just remember: higher profit involves higher risk, so risk management is an important part of trading!\u003C/p>\r\n\u003C/dd>\r\n\u003Cdt>How to make forecasts?\u003C/dt>\r\n\u003Cdd>\r\n\u003Cp>The last question is: how do traders know what currency pairs to trade and when to buy or sell them?\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>Currency rate depends on its supply and demand, which may change depending on the economic situation of the country (GDP, inflation, the labor market situation, etc.). This is why political, economic and social phenomena that influence local economy also influence currency rates. Learning HOW these factors influence profitability is the key to Forex trading.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>There are 2 major tools that indicate the best moment to buy or sell.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003C/dd>\r\n\u003Cdt>Fundamental analysis\u003C/dt>\r\n\u003Cdd>\r\n\u003Cp>It is all about following economic news in different countries.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>\r\n\u003Cb>For example:\u003C/b> you see that Canadian unemployment rate declined, which means that the CAD will rise. Sell USD/CAD and just wait!\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>A thing like that happened on January 5th, 2018 – Canadian unemployment rate fell, and USD fell to CAD from 1.250 to 1.236. Trading $100 with 1: 3000 leverage, a trader could have made a profit of $3398.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003C/dd>\r\n\u003Cdt>Graphic analysis\u003C/dt>\r\n\u003Cdd>\r\n\u003Cp>You can use currency rate charts to make forecasts – the pattern on the graph can tell you what to do. Let’s review the simplest and most popular “Head and Shoulders” pattern.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>It consists of three peaks that make a “head” and two “shoulders”.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>When all three peaks are formed, draw a neckline through the lows that were formed by all three peaks. After that, measure a distance from the “head” peak to the neckline. It is an approximate distance that the pair will go down from the neckline. The “Head and Shoulders” pattern is a strong signal to sell.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>Luckily, you don’t need to have a degree in finance to master it! FBS broker has an exceptional section of educational and analytical materials explaining how to act when prices go up or down in simple terms.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003C/dd>\r\n\u003C/dl>","content.vocabulary.buy-sell":"\u003Cp>'Trading Forex' means buying or selling currency pairs, metals, or indices. Currencies are always traded in pairs. It's logical: to find out the relative value of one currency, you need to compare it with another currency. When you buy one currency, you automatically sell another currency.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>In practice, this means that you perform an operation with a pair made of these two currencies. For example, if you expect the euro to appreciate against the US dollar, you buy EUR/USD. This is a common Forex transaction ('trade'). To perform it, you need to open a trading program (MetaTrader 4 or 5 or FBS Trader), click on a 'New order' button and then choose 'Buy'.\u003C/p>","content.vocabulary.currencies":"\u003Cp>The first currency in a pair is called the base currency, while the second currency is called the quote or counter currency. The price of the base currency is always calculated in units of the quote currency.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>For example, the exchange rate for EUR/USD is 1.1900. It means that 1 euro costs 1.1900 US dollars (one dollar and 19 cents). It’s essential to learn that the terms ‘buy’ and ‘sell’ apply to the base currency (in this example, the EUR is the base currency, the USD is the quote currency).\u003C/p>","content.vocabulary.lot":"\u003Cp>A lot is a number of currency units. A standard lot equal to 100 000 units of a base currency. For EUR/USD, one lot means 100 000 EUR. To open a trade, you will need to decide how much money to put into it. In a trading platform, you will see the ‘volume’ parameter when you decide to open a new order. If you want to trade 1 lot, choose ‘1.00’. You can also trade several lots or partial lots. The smallest trade size is ‘0.01’ (1 000 units of a base currency). Notice that the actual amount of money needed to open such a trade may be even smaller because of leverage.\u003C/p>","content.vocabulary.order":"\u003Cp>To trade Forex, you need to place orders – give special commands to your broker in the trading platform. There are several types of orders.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>Market orders – buy and sell – will allow you to open positions at the current market price. The position will be opened immediately after you place such an order. What if you don’t like the current price? For example, you are confident that the pair will skyrocket, but only if it reaches a certain level. Pending orders will help you out! They will allow you to choose entry levels in advance, so that you won’t have to sit in front of the screen, waiting. With a pending order, the trade will be automatically opened once the price gets to the level that you have chosen. Handy, right?\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>There are four types of pending orders, and no words will make them clearer for you than the picture below:\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>Well, you’ve learned how to open positions, but what about closing trades? In order to close profitable positions, use an order type called Take Profit. In order to close an unprofitable trade and prevent a bigger loss, use a Stop Loss. For example, you set a Take Profit 100 points away from your entry point. As soon as the market moves 100 points in your favor, your order will be automatically closed and 100 points in USD or EUR will be added to your account. The protective Stop Loss in a trade like this may equal 30 points.\u003C/p>","content.vocabulary.point":"\u003Cp>Points represent the smallest change a price can make. Exchange rates are counted to five decimal points. For example, the price GBP/USD can be like this: 1.3000. However, there are some pairs that have 3 decimal points. For example, the USD/JPY may trade at 103.705. The last decimal sign of a price/quotation represents a point.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>If EUR/USD changed from 1.19000 to 1.19005, this would be a change of 5 points. If USD/JPY changed from 103.000 to 103.013, this would be a change of 13 points.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>Let’s learn how to calculate the value of one point.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>We will use the USD/JPY pair as an example. The exchange rate is 103.800.\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>(0.001 (a point) / 103.800 (an exchange rate) X 100 000 (a standard lot) = $0.96 per point\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>Let’s consider a pair where the USD is not a base currency. For example, EUR/USD. If the USD is your account currency and the exchange rate is 1.19000, the calculation will be like this:\u003C/p>\r\n\u003Cp>(0.00001 / 1) X 100 000 = $1 per point\u003C/p>","content.vocabulary.profit":"\u003Cp>To make a profit you need to buy at a lower price and close the trade when the price increases or to sell at a higher price and close the trade when the price declines. The decision to buy or sell a currency pair depends on your expectations of the future price. If you think that EUR/USD will rise, you buy this pair or, in other words, open a long position on this pair. If you think that the EUR/USD will fall, you sell the pair or, as traders say, open a short position. As some time passes and the price of EUR/USD changes, you close the position and get the profit if the price changes in line with your expectations. If the price moved in the opposite way, you would have a loss on this transaction.\u003C/p>","label.about":"About","label.about-connect":"Connect your Facebook account to your personal area.","label.about-download":"Download the FBS – Trading Broker to double your bonus (get additional $70).","label.about-get-free":"Get free $70.","label.about-learn":"Learn trading and pass a quick Forex trading test.","label.about-trade":"Trade for 20 active trading days with max 5 days missed in the process and withdraw the profit earned with the Level Up Bonus account","label.about-verify":"Verify your email.","label.account.active-days":"Active trading days","label.account.bonus-progress":"Bonus progress","label.account.btn-level-up":"Level Up!","label.balance":"Balance","label.btn-basic-concepts":"Basic concepts of the forex market","label.btn-create-account":"Create account","label.btn-email-step":"Confirm email","label.btn-facebook-step":"Connect your account","label.btn-how-to":"How to make money on forex","label.btn-modal":"Continue to level up","label.btn-ok":"Ok","label.btn-popup-cancel":"Cancel","label.btn-popup-connect-facebook":"Connect another account","label.btn-proceed":"Proceed","label.btn-skip":"Skip","label.btn-test-step":"Start your test","label.btn-trading-step":"Check progress","label.btn-transaction":"","label.btn-transfer-profit":"Transfer profit","label.btn-welcome-step":"Open level up account","label.btn.popup-completed-test":"Continue to level up","label.completed-failed-result":"Your profit {{ profit }}","label.day":"day","label.days-left":"Days left","label.days-missed":"Days missed","label.days-traded":"Days traded","label.disqualified-result":"You are disqualified","label.double-step":"Double your bonus","label.email-step":"Confirm your email","label.facebook-step":"Join us in Facebook","label.failed-result":"Conditions are not met","label.fulfill-result":"Your profit {{ profit }}","label.how-to-forex":"How to make money on forex","label.level-beginner":"Beginner","label.level-middle":"Middle","label.level-professional":"Professional","label.modal-title":"You reached a new level!","label.profit":"Profit","label.quiz":"The test","label.terms-and-conditions":"Terms and conditions","label.test-step":"Take the test","label.total-profit":"Total profit","label.traded-lots":"Traded lots","label.trading-disabled":"Trading is disabled","label.trading-step":"Start trading","label.transfer-funds-progress":"Results in progress","label.transfer-rejected":"Rejected","label.transferred-result":"Congratulations!","label.vocabulary":"Your basic Forex vocabulary","label.vocabulary.buy-sell":"Buy or Sell","label.vocabulary.currencies":"Base and quote currencies","label.vocabulary.finish":"Well done!

The difference between the Open and Close prices must exceed fifty-nine (59) points.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Status Points are calculated according to the following formula:\u003Cbr>\u003Cstrong>Number of traded lots * Loyalty Status Coefficient\u003C/strong>\u003Cbr>(see the table in Annex №1 for Coefficient).\u003C/li>\u003Cli>If you trade stocks in Meta Trader 5, the stock lot is counted as 0.1 of a standard lot.

Your Prize Points Coefficient increases according to your level (starting from Gold Status).\u003C/li>\u003Cli>For the Prize Points Coefficient and Loyalty Status, see the table in Annex №1.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>To upgrade the Loyalty Status, you can get Status Points and/or increase the total deposit amount (or the turnover of your clients). For the Status Points and total deposit amount required to get Loyalty Status, see the tables in Annex №2.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>When you get a new Loyalty Status, the Status Points calculation, as well as the calculation of your total deposit amount or your clients’ turnover, starts over.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Your Loyalty Status is valid throughout one (1) calendar year from its attainment. If you meet the requirements for an upgrade, a new Loyalty Status will be assigned to you automatically. After a 365-day period, your Loyalty Status will still be updated according to the conditions: remain unchanged or go down to a lower level.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Only the progress made within the previous calendar year is considered for the fulfillment of the conditions.\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Example:\u003C/strong> A Participant has a Gold Loyalty Status from December31, 2021. Suppose the Participant won’t upgrade to a Platinum Loyalty Status by December 31, 2022 and fail to confirm the current Gold Loyalty Status (get enough Status Points and deposit enough funds or get enough clients’ turnover). In that case, the Status of the Participant will change to a Silver one (in case the Participant has a sufficient amount of Status Points and deposits enough or gets enough of the clients’ turnover) or a Green one (if the Participant has not fulfilled the conditions for the Silver status).\u003C/p>\u003C/li>\u003Cli>A Participant can be a Trader, a Partner, or both.

When you upgrade to a new Loyalty Status, your Loyalty Status Coefficient will be increased so that you can earn points faster.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Prize Points are credited once an order is closed. The Prize Points history is available in the “History” section.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Prize Points will not be credited for trading on demo or bonus funds.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Prize Points are valid for one (1) year from the day of their attainment. The Prize Points that were not redeemed within the validity period (one (1) year after crediting) expire after the period is over. Prize Points expire gradually.\u003Cbr>\u003Cstrong>Example:\u003C/strong> You get 10 Prize Points in January and 20 more in February, so 30 in total. They will be valid for 1 year, and you can use them anytime. If you don’t redeem your Prize Points, next year in January, the first 10 will expire, and in a month, the rest 20 will expire too.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Participants may invite their friends to FBS, and both will be rewarded one (1) Prize Point for one (1) Friend if the following requirements are met:\u003Cul>\u003Cli>The person invited (Friend) doesn’t have an FBS account yet;\u003C/li>\u003Cli>A Friend has followed a special referral link (“ppf=”) shared by a Participant to open a new FBS account;\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Prize Points are credited to both Participant and Friend whenever the Friend verifies their Personal Area and trades 2 lots (the difference between the Open and Close price must not be less than 59 points).\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Note that the “Invite a friend” option has no relation to the FBS IB Program.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>You are allowed to invite as many Friends as you want.
